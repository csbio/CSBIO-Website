# CSBIO-Website

### Editing Instructions
The lab website is stored on github. Franklin and Lovelace both have downstream
copies of the repository. If you want to make a change, add a page, a paper,
or a news item, follow these steps. These steps assume you have a github
account, and are a member of the csbio team.

1. Clone the git repo to your computer:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:csbio/CSBIO-Website.git
```
1. Alternatively, refresh your local copy before you begin with 'git pull'

2. Make your changes, and preview them in your local browser--to the extent you can.
3. Upload your changes to github with 'git push'
4. Notify bvander@cs.umn.edu to pull the changes down to the webservers.
